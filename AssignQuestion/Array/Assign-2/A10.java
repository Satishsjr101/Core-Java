/*Q.10 Check for Majority Element in a sorted array
Given an array arr of N elements, A majority element in an array arr of size N 
is an element that appears more than N/2 times in the array. The task is to 
write a function say isMajority() that takes an array (arr[] ), arrayâ€™s size (n)
and a number to be searched (x) as parameters and returns true if x is 
a majority element (present more than n/2 times).

Examples:
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10}, x = 3
Output: True (x appears more than n/2 times in the given array)
Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6}, x = 4
Output: False (x doesn't appear more than n/2 times in the given array)
Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 2, 2}, x = 1
Output: True (x appears more than n/2 times in the given array
METHOD 1 (Using Linear Search): Linearly search for the first occurrence of 
the element, once you find it (let at index i), check element at index i + n/2. If 
element is present at i+n/2 then return 1 else return 0. */

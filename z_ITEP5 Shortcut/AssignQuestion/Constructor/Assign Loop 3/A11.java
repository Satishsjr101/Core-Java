/*Q.11 Create class Product (pid, price, quantity) with parameterized constructor. Create a main 
function in different class (say XYZ) and perform following task: 
    a. Accept five product information from user and store in an array  
    b. Find Pid of product with highest price.  
    c. Create method (with array of productâ€™s object as argument) in XYZ class to calculate and return 
    total amount spent on all products. (amount spent on single product=price of product * quantity of 
    product).    */
